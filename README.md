# Princeton University: Data Structures and Algorithms - Course Assignments

This repository contains the weekly assignments for the Princeton University Data Structures and Algorithms course offered on Coursera. The assignments are designed to reinforce the material covered in the lectures, providing hands-on experience with the key concepts of data structures and algorithms. Below is a brief description of each week's assignment.

## Week 1: Percolation

### Assignment: Percolation
In this assignment, you will model and simulate the percolation process in a grid using the union-find data structure. You will write a program to estimate the percolation threshold by running experiments on an N-by-N grid and calculating the fraction of open sites required for the system to percolate.

## Week 2: Deques and Randomized Queues

### Assignment: Deques and Randomized Queues
This assignment involves implementing two data structures: a double-ended queue (deque) and a randomized queue. You will write implementations that support constant time operations for insertion and deletion at both ends of the deque and for random insertion and deletion in the randomized queue.

## Week 3: Collinear Points

### Assignment: Pattern Recognition
You will develop a program to recognize line patterns in a set of points in the plane. Specifically, you will find all line segments containing 4 or more points. This involves sorting the points and using geometric properties to identify collinear points.

## Week 4: 8 Puzzle

### Assignment: 8 Puzzle
This assignment requires you to solve the 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm. You will implement a solver that finds the shortest solution to rearrange a given 3x3 board of tiles so that the tiles are in a specified goal configuration.

## Week 5: Kd-Trees

### Assignment: Kd-Trees
You will implement a data structure called a kd-tree to efficiently support range search and nearest neighbor search in a set of 2D points. The assignment focuses on creating a balanced kd-tree and performing search operations within specified ranges and for the nearest point.
